***Initial run:***

Test corpus:
After setting a condition on sentence length, we processed 934 sentences.
number of items parsed: 21
average number of parses per parsed item: 1.1
most ambiguous item: 2 parses
sources of ambiguity: In the 2 setences that have ambiguity, the ambiguity comes from the order of applying BASIC-HEAD-OPT-COMP and HEAD-COMP rule

Test suite:
We processed 55 sentences
number of items parsed: 20
average number of parses per parsed item: 6.31
most ambiguous item: 58 parses
sources of ambiguity: The sentences with the most ambiguity were those that involved coordination, especially of more than 2 constituents.
There were ambiguities related to what order the constituents coordinated in.

Sentences:
1. (testsuite #5)
yoto ka ani ca
1pc.inc nsg.fut eat what
'What will we eat'

The MRS for this sentence does make sense, but the INDEX.SF does classifies this as a prop-or-ques rather than a question.

2. (testsuite #9)
manaon-n i ciri
egg-3sg.poss 3sg break
'Their egg hatched'

This sentence should not have parsed since it uses the wrong possession strategy. Even so, the MRS for this sentence does not include possession.

3. (testsuite #14)
yaye-m i alisai
mother-2sg.poss 3sg laugh
'Your mother laughed'

This sentence should have been parsed. However, the MRS does not involve any posession predication.

4. (testsuite #16)
pala-n i alisai
head-3sg.poss 3sg laugh
'his/her head laughed'

Similarly to the last sentence, this one was correctly parsed, but the MRS does not have a possession predication.

5. (testsuite #24)
ala alisai
3pl laugh
'They laughed'
There is only the 'laugh' predication in the MRS and the ARG1 of 'laugh' is not identifying with anything which is unexpected

6. (testsuite #49)
ato ra.
3pc spring.out
’They sprung out (of the pod)’

The sentence is grammatical but have 3 parses. The sentence is analyzed as having the subject dropped.
Therefore, the ARG1 of 'sprung out' is not identitfying with any agents.

7. (testsuite #46)
i ki nyu
3sg 3sg.fut swim
'He will swim'

The MRS makes sense, identifying the arg1 of the swim predication with the arg0 of the pronoun predication. Additionally, the INDEX.E.TENSE
is correctly marked as future.

8. (test corpus #1282)
i cani nou
3sg count day
'She counted days'
Although the arg1 of the count predication is not identified with anything, the arg2 links correctly to the day predication.

9. (test corpus #1584)
dasi-n i va lavan-m
brother-3sg 3sg say master-2sg.ps
His brother said Your chief.

The MRS for this sentence does not have any possession predications. Our initial grammar has not yet encoded adnominal possession.

10. (test corpus #864)
moen cinal i ta doqoa-n
def devil 3sg measure form-3sg
The devil measured his head.

The MRS almost makes sense, but does not have a possession relation between head and a 3sg entity.


***Final run:***

Test corpus:
After setting a condition on sentence length, we processed 934 sentences.
number of items parsed: 131
average number of parses per parsed item: 42.3
most ambiguous item: 910
sources of ambiguity: This week, we decided to go back to allowing asydenton coordination (but only for sentences), as we saw a lot of
items in the item file that seem to involve asyndeton coordination. This allowed for more sentences to be parsed, but also added much much much
more ambiguity. Additionally, as discussed in the demo day for this week, our grammar currrently does not put constraints on the forms of the
sentences that are being coordinated.

Test suite:
We processed 55 sentences
number of items parsed: 33
average number of parses per parsed item: 19
most ambiguous item: 368
sources of ambiguity: Once again, the main source of ambiguity is coordination. The sentences with the most parses all involved coordination,
especially of more than 2 constituents.

Sentences:
1. (testsuite #1)
se i mat
who 3sg die
'Who died'

As discussed in demo day, we get additional parses for this sentence because the FORM value is not constrained by coordination. However,
there is one parse that seems to be the correct one: it correctly identifies the arg1 of the die predication to the arg0 of the which predication,
which is in turn identified with the arg0 of the person predication. It is also correctly identified as a sentence.

2. (testsuite #4)
i alisai se
3sg laugh who
'Who laughed'

This sentence is ungrammatical. However, it parses because of the FORM value not being constrained by coordination as
mentioned earlier. So, "i alisai" and "se" are coordinated. This is becauase "se" has 2 lexical entries, one as a verb meaning "sit", and
another as the question word "who". So, as expected, the MRS does not make much sense.

3. (testsuite #5)
yoto ka ani ca
1pc.inc nsg.fut eat what
'What will we eat'

The MRS for this sentence does make sense, and even has the arg0 of the which predication identified with the arg0 of the thing predication.
Additionally, the INDEX.SF value is ques.

4. (testsuite #7)
manaon eala i ciri
egg 3pl.poss 3sg break
'Their egg hatched'

The MRS for this sentence makes sense, identifying the arg0 of the egg predication with the arg1 of the possession predication, as well as
the arg1 of the break predication.

5. (testsuite #21)
manaon e Pamei i ciri
egg poss Pmaei 3sg break
'Pamei's egg hatched'

There are a few parses for this sentence, some of which are analyzed as questions. For the two parses that are not explicitly analyzed as questions, the MRS makes sense, identifying the arg1 of the posession predication with the arg0 of the egg predication, and the arg2 of the possession predication with the arg0 of the Pamei predication. The difference between these two parses is that one of them is formed with the HEAD-ADJ rule, and the other with the HEAD-ADJ-INT rule. For new grammar we have commented out HEAD-ADJ in rule.tdl

6. (testsuite #25)
yaye-m i alisai
mother-2sg.poss 3sg laugh
'Your mother laughed'

One of the parses is analyzed as a question. The other one has a sensible MRS, that identifies the arg0 of the mother predication with the
arg1 of the laugh predication, as well as the arg1 of the possession predication.

7. (testsuite #19)
yo u pas manaon i ciri
1sg 1sg.S know egg 3sg break
'I knew that the egg hatched '

This sentence should be ungrammatical. However, it parsed due to coordination not constraining form, as discussed earlier. Therefore, none of the MRS make sense because there is coordination involved.

8. (testsuite #18)
yo u va manaon i ciri
1sg 1sg.S think egg 3sg break
'I thought that the egg hatched '

Like the last sentence, there are a lot of erroneous parses that were formed due to wonky coordination. However, this sentence is
supposed to be grammatical, and thus one of the parses is the one that we expect. For this parse, the MRS looks good. The arg1 of the think
predication is identified with the arg0 of the pronoun predication. The arg2 of the think predication is identified with something in HCONS.
We posted about this on Canvas to confirm that it was the correct analysis.

9. (test corpus #864)
moen cinal i ta doqoa-n
def devil 3sg measure form-3sg
The devil measured his head.

One parse for this sentence is analyzed as a question. For the other parse, the MRS looks good. The arg1 of the measure predication is
identified with the arg0 of the devil predication, while the arg2 of the measure predication is identified with the arg0 of the head predication.
Additionally, the arg0 of the head predication is identified with the arg1 of the possession predication.

10. (test corpus #1021)
ala va yota ka mulie
3pl say 1pl.inc hort turn
They said let s turn around

For this sentence, there are 4 extra parses due to the coordination problem. For the last parse, the MRS does make sense. The arg1 of the
say predication is identified with something in ICONS that is non-focus, which we are not sure about. However, the arg2 of the say predication
is identified with HARG in HCONS. There is also a return predication, and its arg1 is correctly identified with the arg0 of a pronoun predication.


2./3.

***Matrix-wh questions***

For matrix-wh questions, Titan uses "se" (who), and "ca" (what). These words always have the same form regardless of person or number. These
words appear in the same position as the argument would be in a declarative clause. This is true regardless of if the wh-question concerns
subject or non-subject arguments. There is no fronting.

For example, the following is grammatical:

  yoto ka ani ca
  1pc.inc nsg.fut eat what
  'What will we eat'

On the other hand, the following example, which fronts the wh-word, is ungrammatical:

  ca yoto ka ani
  what 1pc.inc nsg.fut eat
  'What will we eat'

The following is a grammatical example with "se" as the subject:

  se i mat
  who 3sg die
  'Who died'

Looking in the item file, it seems that "se" must agree with a verb that is marked with the 3sg marker. This aligns with our previous
documentation: if the subject is not explicitly marked as plural, agreement with the verb must be syntactically singular.
So, the following, where the verb is marked with 3pl, would be ungrammatical.

  se ala mat
  who 3pl die
  'Who died'

To represent this, on the lexicon page of the customization form, we moved "se" and "ca" to a new category, which we marked as being a
wh-word. We also changed the predication names to be "person_n_rel" and "thing_n_rel" to make the semantics make more sense.
On the wh-question page, we specified that question phrases cannot be fronted. This is reflected in the following choice file lines:

        section=wh-q
        front-matrix=in-situ



***Embedded complement clauses***

We only found one verb in Titan that can embed clausal complements. This verb is "va" meaning either "think" or "say". There were no examples
with verbs other than "va", and there was no detailed explanation in the reference grammar. Because of this, we chose to add only "va" to the
class of verbs that can take clausal complements, but we are not entirely sure because there are no negative examples in the item file.
Our items file and reference grammar also did not have any examples of interrogative clauses.
The embedded clause is not marked at all, there are no affixes or complementizers. The embedded clause appears in the same position
as the object would. Additionally, the word order in the embedded clause is the same as the main clause (SVO).

The following is an example of an embedded declarative clause:

  yo u va manaon i ciri
  1sg 1sg.S think egg 3sg break
  'I thought that the egg hatched '

On the other hand, the following is a verb that is not "va", and thus is ungrammatical:

  yo u pas manaon i ciri
  1sg 1sg.S know egg 3sg break
  'I knew that the egg hatched'

To reflect this, we first moved "va" to its own class in the lexicon.

      verb4_name=verb4_trans_claus
        verb4_feat1_name=form
        verb4_feat1_value=nonfinite
        verb4_feat1_head=verb
      verb4_valence=trans,comps1
        verb4_stem1_orth=va
        verb4_stem1_pred=_say-or-think-or-want_v_rel

Then, on the clausal complements page, we added a clausal complement type. We specified that it appears in the same position as
regular noun complements. We also said that it is for embedding propositions. To ensure that the embedded clause takes a sentence, we
specified that the form of the complement must be finite, as shown in the following choices snippet.

      comps1_clause-pos-same=on
      comps1_ques=prop
        comps1_feat1_name=form
        comps1_feat1_value=finite



***Adnominal possession***


Titan uses a variety of methods to mark posession, depending on the kind of noun that is the possessum (aka if the posession is alienable or
inalienable).

Certain nouns are "inalienably" possessed. These nouns include mainly body parts and blood relations, along with a few other
miscellaneous nouns, for example "aqan" (language) and "molua" (soul). Inalienable possession is marked with a suffix. The form of the
suffix is dependent on the person and number of the possessor. The forms are as follows:

Person        Form
1sg           -o or NULL
2sg           -m
3sg           -n
1dl.incl      -yotaru
1dl.excl      -yoru
2dl           -waru
3dl           -aru
1pc.incl      -yoto
1pc.excl      -yoito
2pc           -woto
3pc           -ato
1pl.incl      -yota
1pl.excl      -yoya
2pl           -awa
3pl           -ala


For all nonsingular forms, the suffix has the same form as the personal pronoun for that number and person value.
For 2sg and 3sg, according to the reference grammar, if the noun ends in an consonant, a vowel is added between the noun and the suffix.
However, in the item file, this added vowel is not represented, so we have also chosen to stick with the item file.
For the 1sg suffix, there is allomoprhy that depends on the form of the noun. If the noun ends in "a", that vowel is replaced by the suffix
"-o". Otherwise, the suffix has null form.

Below are some examples:

    yaye-m i alisai
    mother-2sg.poss 3sg laugh
    'Your mother laughed'

    pala-n i alisai
    head-3sg.poss 3sg laugh
    'his/her head laughed'

Importantly, the pernum value of the possessive suffix has no effect on the pernum of the noun, and thus agreement with the verb in the
above examples is still 3sg.


On the other hand, if a noun does not fall in this category, it is alienable, and there is a different possession strategy that applies.
This strategy involves the preposition "e", and the form of the phrase is POSSESSUM e POSSESSOR. This is illustrated in the following
examples:

    manaon e Pamei i ciri
    egg poss Pmaei 3sg break
    'Pamei's egg hatched'

    manaon e ni i ciri
    egg poss fish 3sg break
    'A fish's egg hatched'

If the possessor is a pronoun, then the e and the pronoun combine to form one word. The reference grammar expresses uncertainty as to
whether cases like this actually involve e and the pronoun forming a single word, or if this should be analyzed as separate words.
However, these cases are analyzed as a single word in the item file, so we have used this analysis.


If a noun falls in the category that can be inalienably possessed, it cannot use the alienable possession strategies, and vice versa.
For example:

      pala ei i alisai
      head-3sg.poss 3sg laugh
      'his/her head laughed'

The above sentence involves "pala", which is a body part, and thus must be inalienably possessed. So, the above example, which uses
the alienable possession strategy, is ungrammatical.
On the flip side:

    manaon-n i ciri
    egg-3sg.poss 3sg break
    'Their egg hatched'

"manaon" does not fall in the list of nouns that are inalienably possessed. Therefore, it cannot use the suffixation strategy for
inalienable possession.

To change this in the choices file, first we reorganized the noun classes. We decided to make our original noun class, noun1, the class for
alienably possessed nouns. We moved all nouns that are inalienably possessed to another category. However, to reflect the morphology change for
the 1sg inalienable suffix, we created 2 classes. One class included inalienable nouns that have a stem ending in "a", and the other category
was for all other inalienable nouns.

    noun109_name=noun109_inalienable_noa
      noun109_feat1_name=pernum
      noun109_feat1_value=3rd

    noun110_name=noun110_inalienable_a
      noun110_feat1_name=pernum
      noun110_feat1_value=3rd


For nouns that end in "a", we had an issue. Since we are currently only using the customization page, we were unable to make it so that the
"a" in the stem would be replaced by the "o" from the suffix. For now, we have said that a noun like "pala", when posseessed by the 1sg suffix,
will have the form "pala-o". However, in the item file, it is "palo".

For inalienable possession, we added a class of possessor pronouns (poss-pron1). We said these pronouns are affixes that don't agree in PNG
with the possessum.

      poss-pron1_type=affix
      poss-pron1_agr=non-agree
      poss-pron1_mod-spec=spec


Then, in the morphology section, we created 3 noun inflection position classes. These position classes are obligatorily
appearing suffixes.

One position class deals with the 1sg suffix for nouns ending in "a". The possible input for this class is only the class
of inalienable nouns ending in a. For this position class, we added a lexical rule that adds the suffix "-o."

    noun-pc2_name=poss_inal_1sga
    noun-pc2_obligatory=on
    noun-pc2_order=suffix
    noun-pc2_inputs=noun110
      noun-pc2_lrt1_name=inalienable_1sg_a
        noun-pc2_lrt1_feat1_name=poss-pron1
        noun-pc2_lrt1_feat1_value=plus
        noun-pc2_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
        noun-pc2_lrt1_feat2_name=pernum
        noun-pc2_lrt1_feat2_value=1sg
        noun-pc2_lrt1_feat2_head=possessor
        noun-pc2_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
        noun-pc2_lrt1_lri1_orth=-o

On the other hand, our position class that deals with the 1sg suffix for nouns ending in a letter other than "a"
have only 1 possible input class: the class of inalienable nouns not ending in a. For this position class, we createed a lexical rule
that adds a null suffix.

      noun-pc3_name=poss_inal_1sg_noa
      noun-pc3_obligatory=on
      noun-pc3_order=suffix
      noun-pc3_inputs=noun109
        noun-pc3_lrt1_name=poss_inal_1sgnoa
          noun-pc3_lrt1_feat1_name=poss-pron1
          noun-pc3_lrt1_feat1_value=plus
          noun-pc3_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
          noun-pc3_lrt1_feat2_name=pernum
          noun-pc3_lrt1_feat2_value=1sg
          noun-pc3_lrt1_feat2_head=possessor
          noun-pc3_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=no


Finally, our position class for non-1sg suffixes take both classes.
(aka this position class can apply to any inalienable noun, regardless of its last letter). For this class, we created many lexical rules,
to add a suffix based on pernum value.

      noun-pc1_name=poss_inal_non1
      noun-pc1_obligatory=on
      noun-pc1_order=suffix
      noun-pc1_inputs=noun109, noun110
(noun109 and noun110 are nouns not ending in "a" and nouns ending in "a", respectively)

For alienable possession, we had to add both a possessive strategy and a class of possessor pronouns.
We specified a possessum-first strategy, with a word, "e", marking the possessor. It appears before the possessor.

      poss-strat1_order=head-initial
      poss-strat1_mod-spec=mod
      poss-strat1_mark-loc=possessor
      poss-strat1_pronoun-allow=no
      poss-strat1_possessor-type=non-affix
      poss-strat1_possessor-mark-order=head-initial
      poss-strat1_possessor-agr=non-agree
      poss-strat1_possessor-orth=e

However, for the combined word consisting of "e" and a personal pronoun, we had to create a new class of possessor pronouns. We said this class
involves separate words which appear to the right of the possessum, and we added instances for each pernum value.

      poss-pron2_type=non-affix
      poss-pron2_agr=non-agree
      poss-pron2_mod-spec=mod
      poss-pron2_order=head-initial

Below is an example code snippet for a pernum instance:

    poss-pron2_instance1_name=1sg_poss
    poss-pron2_instance1_orth=eyo
      poss-pron2_instance1_feat1_name=pernum
      poss-pron2_instance1_feat1_value=1sg


4./Misc.
We made some miscellaneous other changes:
Because in the item file, there seem to be examples of asyndeton sentence coordination, we decided to add that back as a coordination
strategy in this lab.

      cs8_s=on
      cs8_pat=a

We also had some redundant verb entries (aka some intransitive verbs also had transitive entries), so we were trying to clean that up.
However, there were a lot of verbs like that, so we only made some progress.

Another change we made, on suggestion from the last lab, was changing the complement of auxiliary verbs to VP instead of V.

    has-aux=yes
    aux-comp-order=before
    aux-comp=vp
    multiple-aux=yes

Although we thought that Titan does not have any concrete examples of adverbial clausal modifiers, as we were going over our phenomenon,
we noticed that there was actually a section on it in the book. We did not have time to implement it this week, but it is something that exists
in Titan. Apparently, there is a word "alan", which can mark clauses that express the meaning of "when, if, because, and although".
